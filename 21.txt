[]: Spirit Labyrinth - Third Floor

“”: Aaaargh! That's it! This is so frustrating!

“”: I'm still nowhere near full strength!

“”: What? Are you not feeling well?

Sfx: Tap Tap
[]: Spirit: Fang-Grasshopper

“”: No, it's not that!
//: I'm also weakened from using a forbidden art.

“”: Just like Kuu.

“”: Anshira mentioned it earlier, didn't she?


//: That this is a special dungeon for violators, the "Path of Sin."

Sfx: DASH!

“”: Yeah.

“”: Kuu and I both committed a violation: using a "forbidden art."


//: That's why we're suffering this punishment, on top of being "weakened."

“”: And since it's a punishment,


//: the difficulty here is much higher than normal.

“”: I see.

page 2

“”: Ah! Don't get the wrong idea!


//: Kuu only used the "forbidden art" because she had to, to protect everyone!

St: It wasn't for some evil purpose!!

Sfx: BOOM!

“”: Right.

“”: Anyway!


//: What we need right now is POWER!

Sfx: CRACK!

Spirit:
Chameleon-Frog

“”: A Spirit Master's "Magic Reinforcement" is essential.

“”: I'm counting on you.

“”: …

“”: Got it.

[]: Fifth Floor

“”: Hm?

page 3

“”: What is this place?

“”: I don't sense any enemies at all.

“”: The fifth floor is a safe zone.

//: No enemies appear, and we can rest for a few hours.

“”: ...Yeah. I see traces here. Kuu rested here.

//: If we push on without stopping, we might be able to catch up...

“”: Are you sure you're okay without a rest?

//: You look exhausted.

“”: I told you that Kuu used the "forbidden art"

//:  to protect herself, didn't I?

“”: That "forbidden art" was extremely powerful.

page 4

“”: So the backlash was devastating.

//: She's far more "weakened" than I am.

OT: Mine was just a minor forbidden art.

“”: ...That's right. When I first met Kuu, she was in the form of a lizard.

“”: See?

//: Her situation is much more critical than mine.

“”: And on top of that!
//: The greatest trial of the "Path of Sin" awaits us on the tenth floor.

“”: The tenth floor?

“”: Yes!
//: There's a special event there that you won't find in normal dungeons.

“”: A duel against another sinner, arranged by the "Kagaribi Organization."

page 5

“”: In other words,

“”: the enemy is also a "Spirit Master"!

“”: They call it the "Purification Duel."

“”: So you see...

“”: Kuu is an exceptionally strong spirit, it's true, but...

“”: As her big sister!

//: I have to protect my little sister!

:: My own problems can wait!

:: Kuu, just hold on!

//: Your big sister is on her way to save you!!!!

“”: …

[]: I'm worried about Kuu too, of course, but...

Page 6

[]: With every floor we descend, the enemies get stronger.

:: The power of a big sister, graaaah!!!

[]: Julith is running out of steam, and she's starting to get more and more wounded.

[]: If we don't take a break...

“”: Come on, let's keep moving!

[]: "Magic Reinforcement" for the spirit is becoming critical.

Ot: Not to brag or anything!?

Sfx: BOOM!

[]: But a slave never gets the chance to learn magic!

[]: I've used Kuu's spirit arts before, but I was just borrowing her power.

Sfx: KLING
Sfx: ZZZT

[]: I don't have the skill to convert my own power into a spell.
