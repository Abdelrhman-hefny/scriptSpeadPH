"": You don't mean that bag of bones over there that looks like he’s on the verge of death, do you?

ST: Huh... 

“”: He was perfectly fine just a moment ago…

"": Still, he properly participated in all the training exercises.

"": Even though I told him it would be tough to keep up with our training regimen…

//: he followed along with a fire in his eyes.

"": At this rate, he'll become an incredible swordsman in a few years time.

"": I see. That's good.

"": !! Yes! You can look forward to it!

"": But, why don't you save that praise for him instead of me?

"": …Pardon?

"": What good does it do me to hear it?

ST: It's not like he'd be happy if I praised him anyway.

"": Uh, for some reason, I felt like I had to report it to you, my Lady...

"": More importantly, what was it that you wanted to ask…?

"": Oh, right.

ST: I almost forgot.

"": It's about the dark mages,

//: where can I go to find them?

"": What? Why so suddenly…

"": Don't tell me…

page 3

"": You're not thinking of taking them on yourself, are you?

"": What, did you think I wanted to meet them to become friends?

"": Of course I'm going to go and crush...

“”: You can't!!!!!

“”: I know you managed to survive last time by sheer luck, but

//: you never know what might happen next time!

"": ...What? Luck?

“”: Did he say luck?

“”: Luuuuuuck?

“”: Alright then. Let's see you experience firsthand whether it was luck or skill.

“”: Let's find out which is stronger, your luck or my skill.

"": N-No, Lady Daphne, wait a moment...! Please calm down…

"": You can't do this…!!

"": I can!!!!

"": D-D-Daphne...!!

"": Y-You're still not well, why are you o-outside!

page 4

"": Huh, Vipera?

"": Why are you...

"": What? Why are you here?!

"": ???

"": Th-That's not the problem!

"": What?

"": D-Daphne. Y-You should be more w-worried about your b-body.

//: It hasn't even been that long since you c-collapsed...!

"": Hello? Can't you see me?

ST: It's been two years since we last saw each other, you know?

"": I-I brought some potions…

"": Here!

"": D-Do you want to try it?

page 5

ST: A potion?

"": Did you learn this from that Taty fellow?

"": N-No, I've always been able to m-make them on my o-own.

"": Let's see...

(): It's clean, with no impurities, and the purity is quite high…

//: As expected, you truly have talent.

ST: My eye for talent never misses.

(): If I train her properly for a few years, she'll become quite useful.

"": ...! She's smiling. I guess she likes the potion!

(): Honestly, I thought she'd call it trash and throw it away again...

"": As I thought...

OT: Daphne has definitely changed.

ST: By the way, what effect does this have?

[]: I can't forget how Daphne bullied me all this time, but

[]: the fact that a famously prideful elf took me as his disciple

//: must have been because Daphne ordered him to.

"": You said your name was Vipera?

//: From today onwards, I will teach you!

ST: An elf?

"": Wh-Who…

page 6

"": I really despise humans!

//: But you're different!

"": Why? Because if I raise you well, I can escape!

"": So let's do our best, okay? Hm? Hm?

(): He seemed a little strange, but well...

[]: Perhaps sending that elf was Daphne's way of apologizing?

[]: If so, as her older sister, I should forgive her, right...?

(): Vipera, my lovely daughter.

(): Please take good care of Daphne...

OT: And Mom asked me to, so...

"": Here! Take this too!

"": Huh?

 

"": It has Yukos leaves, Lisa magic mushrooms, and Modok roots. It restores stamina and recovers some mana. This one is a Telere leaf decoction, effective in healing wounds. Oh! And this one is made from ground-up Madness Fangs, it's great for stopping bleeding, so if you ever get seriously hurt, you have to drink this one before a recovery potion because taking them at the same time lessens the effect, but it stops the bleeding, so it must come first…

ST: Mumble

ST: Mumble

"": And…

"": S-Sorry, I got too carried away...!!

//: I-If you don't like them, should I just take them back?

"": No, this is great. I'll make good use of them. 

//: Thank you.

"": …!

"": …Yeah!

"": What a relie...

"": Wait, wait!!! I don't understand what's going on here?!?

ST: And stop ignoring me!

ST: This is…

ST: Waaah…

"": Vipera, you! You wouldn't budge at all when I yelled at you to come out of your room.

//: What's with this all of a sudden? And since when did you get so close to Daphne?!

ST: Ah

"": C-Close? Do we look close…?

"": Is this really the time to be blushing about that?

"": B-But Daphne granted my r-request.

//: I'm g-grateful. And I feel s-sorry, but she also gave me a gift...

"": A gift?

"": Yeah...! S-Something absolutely priceless!

(): …

ST: I did that?

"": S-So I'm going to act like a proper older sister too!

"": …

page 8

(): The kid who was locked up in her room for two whole years because Daphne bullied her…

ST: Th-Then, is it o-okay if I finish explaining?

ST: Make it short.

(): Did Vipera also sense something from Daphne's recent change in behavior?

(): This feels… kind of like a normal family…

ST: Hmph!

"": Well, anyway, what's with this potion?

//: Since when did you get into alchemy?

"": Is this stuff even legit?

"": O-Of course it is!

"": It should be very effective! B-Because I tested it with my own body!

"": What did you just say?

"": Like cutting myself and pouring the potion on the wound,

ST: This time with a knife…

ST: Huuu!!!

"": or drinking it after an incredibly hard workout,

"": or drinking it in a state of exhaustion after using up all my mana…

ST: Quick, before I pass out…

"": Th-There was an e... effect?

ST: Hehe

page 9

"": D-Did I do something wrong...?

(): I knew she was crazy about alchemy, but I didn't think it was this bad…

ST: The side effects of potions can be detrimental…

"": Arius. Did the knights say they'll keep up this level of training?

"": Huh...? Yeah, they said they're going to do this every day.

"": Then they'll be collapsing from exhaustion every day, right?

"": Yes? They'll be low on stamina, low on mana, and be injured as well…

 

"": Vipera! From now on, use the knights for your experiments!

//: You are forbidden from using your own body!

"": That's right! Those guys are sturdy, so they’ll be useful!

"": Huh? Yeah? I-I can do that…?

“”: Aren't we in danger…?

“”: We're dead either way…

"": In any case, I'm glad you came back outside, Vipera.

"": It's been a while since the three of us were together.

"": Th-The three of us...!

"": It would've been perfect if our older brother were here too. Right?

"": Y-Yeah... but this is g-good too!

"": That's right! This is great too!

(): This feels strange...

OT: To be continued...
