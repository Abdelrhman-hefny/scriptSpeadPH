"": Do you happen to know about the Five-Colored Mana Stone?

"": Agnes… Where did you hear about the Five-Colored Mana Stone?

"": I discovered it in the first emperor's portrait, and I've just come from the library.

"": It was top secret. I had all records of it thoroughly erased…

SFX: Sigh...

"": It's not like I can stop you anyway.

"": It's about time I told you.

OT: Episode 77

OT: Long, long ago,

OT: there was a moment when a rift opened, threatening to swallow the world.

OT: And in the midst of that chaos,

[]: the first emperor's mana and the purple mana stone combined,

[]: shining with a brilliant five-colored light before closing the rift.

[]: And that is how the first emperor protected the empire.

[]: The people of the empire said, "As long as the first emperor and the mana stone exist, the empire will stand strong."

[]: Perhaps from expending too much mana, the first emperor, not long after that…

page 3 

[]: …passed away, and with him, his Five-Colored Mana Stone also vanished.

OT: Fearing the people of the empire would tremble in anxiety if they learned the truth, the imperial family kept it a secret.

"": We thought things would stabilize, but the rifts opened once more,

"": and because of this, many sought out the first emperor's tomb, hoping to find informations

//: about the Five-Colored Mana Stone, but...

"": No one could pass the final threshold.

"": Why not?

"": Because there is a barrier placed on the first emperor's tomb.

(): What kind of barrier could it be?

page 4 

(): But I have to go.

(): To save Kylo and the people of the empire...!

"": Father.

"": I will go.

page 5 

<>: No...!

"": Countless souls have lost their lives trying to enter that tomb...!

"": Besides, you have no reason to go!

<>: But…!

page 6 

"": Many people are trembling in fear.

"": As the Saintess of Light and the princess, I must be the one to go.

<>: Agnes! Are you truly saying this without understanding Father's feelings?!

"": I cannot lose you, too...

"": Stop it, Agnes. Don't make things any harder on Father.

page 7 

"": I can't back down...

(): I'm sorry, Father.

(): There is someone I must protect…!

page 8 

"": I can't possibly enter the tomb alone.

"": But to ask Kylo for help...

//: It's been awkward since that incident....

"": As a princess, my actions were rash.

"": I will be sure to repay you for this, one way or another.

"": Repay me...?

"": Your Highness, you continue to confuse me.

"": Sir Gray...?

page 9 

"": One moment you approach me so suddenly, and the next you push me away when I try to get closer.

"": Is it so difficult... To lean on me, even just a little?

"": That's not it...

"": I'm just afraid you'll be in danger...

"": That's the retreat order. Let's fall back now, Princess.

"": Haah… What should I do?

page 10 

"": Where are you going all alone again?

"": Sir Gray?

"": I-I was just going for a night walk…

"": I was assigned to be your escort today.

"": You're going to the first emperor's tomb, aren't you?

"": Is it truly that difficult to rely on me?

page 11 

"": I'm sorry. That's all I can say.

"": But…

"": I can promise you this one thing, that I can give you my all.

page 12 

"": I won't ask for much.

"": Just please allow me to protect you, Your Highness.

"": For my sake...

"": Won't you permit me at least that...?

"": ...Then I'll be in your care, Sir Gray.

page 13 

"": I'll be going with you as well.

"": There is a trap there that requires at least three people to disable.

"": And you planned to protect Her Highness without even knowing that?

SFX: Grit

"": Whoa, whoa, don't fight. Since it's come to this, let's just head out right away!

page 14 

"": Now, hurry up and follow me!

"": They're moving just as expected.

"": That's right.

"": Duke Solton.
