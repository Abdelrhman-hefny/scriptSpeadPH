** Wait a moment.

“” Before that, don’t we have something to discuss, just the us?

“” Because of what you did,

“” I ended up in a very troublesome situation.

“” This doesn’t do either of us any good.

“” …My apologies, Lady.

“” I never meant to cause you any trouble.

“” It’s all my responsibility.

“” …

() …Yeah, I know. Licht wouldn’t have done that on purpose.

# Imprint   Effect

# Staring in front of everyone

# The flirtatious young lord Knocking him out

# Complaining about the Spring Festival’s outcome

() All of this because of the imprint…

() But was that really the best way to handle it?!



PAGE 3

“” …Young Lord Dmitri. Why did you, of all people, step in?

“” That’s, um…

“” Of course, I’m grateful for your help, but…

“” There were people around us.

“” It could’ve easily spread as a pointless rumor.

“” …That young lord and I.

“” Had a personal grudge.

“” A grudge?

() …Just how bad could that grudge even be?!

() Of all times, why resolve it when it’s perfect for rumors about me?!

[] I was just sitting on the log bridge,

[] And suddenly, a duel broke out.

“” You didn’t have to do that at the Spring Festival.

“” …But didn’t it clearly make you uncomfortable?

“” What?!



PAGE 4

“” That bastard was leeching onto you like a parasite,

“” How could I just stand by!

“” The moment I saw him being rude to you, my body moved on its own.

“” Why would you care if Young Lord Dmitri was being rude to me…

“” You were worried about the Duke, weren't you?

“” I swear. I absolutely… didn’t do it on purpose.

“” Even declaring the festival void just slipped out.

“” What… did you say?

“” I was there at the same place, you know.

“” I heard every bit of nonsense they were saying about you.



PAGE 5

“” I didn’t need to hear more to get angry.

“” Because I truly believed you were the most beautiful one there.

() That was… truly what you thought?

“” More importantly, are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?

() When he’s this gentle, it really feels like he…

() …Ah, I almost forgot for a moment.

() It’s just the effect of the imprint.

“” Why are you worrying about that?



PAGE 6

“” What? Well, of course I…

“” Do you even realize you’re acting

“” Like we’re lovers right now?

() Ah, again without even realizing it…

“” I think I should go for today.

() I need to break the imprint as soon as possible.

“” My eldest son’s refusal to marry is such a headache.

“” Speaking of which, isn’t Marquis Leslie’s second son turning twenty-eight soon?



PAGE 7

“” You know children never go the way their parents wish.

“” He must have his own intentions, I’m sure.

“” Still, you must be relieved you don’t have to worry about your daughter.

“” …Pardon?

“” What do you mean by that?

** Huh?

“” Haven’t you heard?

“” There’s talk that she and Duke Cassio are lovers.

“” O-Our Luci? You mean her?!

“” Wait, who did you just say?

“” It’s been all the talk since the Spring Festival.

** Huhhh?!

“” Rumors tend to grow on their own, of course,

“” But there are quite a few nobles who claim they’ve seen your daughter

“” Together with the Duke.



PAGE 8

“” Duke Cassio, huh? How enviable!

() What did I just hear…?

“” Dear, that thing we heard earlier today,

“” What on earth was that about?

“” …Ah, come to think of it.

“” …Duke Cassio did come by the house once.

“” What? To our house?

“” Not intentionally, his carriage had stopped for a moment…

“” But he spoke to me first, and I thought that was strange.

() It honestly felt like he was trying to call for Luciana…

“” …So that happened, huh.



PAGE 9

“” Sorry I’m late.

“” Ah, Lucy. Come, sit down.

“” You look tired. Haven’t you been sleeping well?

“” Ah… I’ve just had a lot to do lately.

() She doesn’t look like someone in love, though…

[] Looks the same as she did before graduating from the academy.

[] Someone in love should look…

() So it really is a false rumor, huh.

() Still, I’d better ask to be sure.

“” Oh, Lucy.

“” There’s a rumor going around that you're Duke Cassio’s lover.

“” Lucy, are you alright?

“” Yes, why wouldn’t I be.

() It’s only been two days, just how far has this rumor spread?



PAGE 10

“” From that reaction, I take it you hadn’t heard yet.

“” Don’t worry, it’s nothing serious.

“” I only asked because people are talking,

“” About you and Duke Cassio being seen together.

“” It’s just nonsense, right?

 
** I knew it…!

“” ...It’s true.

“” I was with Duke Cassio.

<> What?!
