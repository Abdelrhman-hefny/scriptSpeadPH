“” No?  
“” ...You have to be gentle.  
“” ...?  
“” I'll let it slide this time because you're pretty.

() I'll have to take care of it in the bathroom.  
“” Wait!  
“” !  
“” I'll put you to sleep.  
“” Good night, honey.

“” I'll get you back double for this when we're back in Seoul.  
“” Hey, did Mr. Cha Dojin leave?  
“” Yeah. Thank you for not asking anything even though you must've been flustered last night.  
“” I came straight from work, so I'll be going ahead.  
“” Okay, travel safe.  
“” But are you alright?  
“” Huh?! What do you mean?  

page 4  
“” Does your jaw hurt?  Or maybe your teeth?  
“” I saw you keep holding that side of your face.  
() How can I tell her it's because of a rough kiss we had yesterday...!!!  
<> Ugh...!!  
** Ahaha...  
“” It's nothing! Maybe it's my wisdom tooth?? It just feels a little itchy!  
() Anyone can understand it’s clearly an excuse...!!  
“” Are you sure it's not an allergic reaction?  I think there's some medicine at the studio apartment...  
“” No, it's not that...  
“” More importantly, isn't it time for us to get back there soon?  
“” Ah!  If we leave now, we'll probably make it on time!  
“” Right?! Let's hurry!  
() Thank goodness A-ri is so innocent...!  
** I'm sorry, A-ri...

“” Wow~ It's been a while since I've been to a broadcasting station.  
“” By the way, I haven't seen writer Wooseok at all since we were at the airport.  
“” Huh? You're right.  
() Come to think of it, I haven't seen him since yesterday...  
“” Ah~ Wooseok?  
“” He left.  
“” Huh? Left? Where to?  
“” Our drama's script is all done. He said he needed to rest and went on a trip. I think he said Hungary?  
** I’m going.  
“” Anyway, he went to Incheon airport this morning and got on a plane right away.  

page 6  
() He did say he was going to disappear... but so suddenly?  
“” What about the rest of our filming?  
() I'm a little worried...  
“” The script isn't changing, and we can still contact him.  
“” If something comes up, we can use the internet or call him, so what does it matter?  
 
** You're right about that.  
“” Oh!  And now that I think about it, isn't  today our first episode on air?  
“” Ah~ You're right? After I go home and wash up, I can watch it right away!  
“” I'm so excited to see people's reactions~!  
“” In our first episode, you and Jian have that deep kiss!  
“” The deep kiss ending!  
“” You're just spoiling things out in the open?  

page 7  
“” Aw, come on, man. It's fine, right?  
() Was all of the kiss scenes in episode one?  
** I kind of forgot!!!  
[] Quiet~  
  
“” It doesn't look like Dojin's here.  
“” Right... He was working even before coming to Udo, so.  
() I did want to watch the drama I filmed with him...  
() But watching the kiss scene with him is a bit much.

“” 100% juicy chicken thigh meat!  
“” Hmm~ Hmmhmm~  
“” Ah~ This is refreshing!  
“” Is it good?  
“” Yeah!  Of cour...  
“” Dojin...?! 

page 9  
“” What are you doing here...  
“” No, did you know today was the airing of my first episode?  
“” Yeah.  I came to watch it together.  
“” Oh... that's great! I wanted to watch it with you, too.  
() This is a disaster...  
“” Hahaha~  
() Was this in episode 1, too? The TV is too big... 
** Should I just get rid of it...?  
() He must be so mad...  
() He's going to stare a hole right through the screen...  
“” Your face looks like you want to confess something.  

page 10  
# Guilt  
“” ...if I confess, will you forgive me?  
“” I said I'd get you back double for this, didn't I?  
“” We can just pick up where we left off.  
“” The interrupted bed scene right there.  
“” Ah...  
() It looks like I won't be sleeping tonight...
