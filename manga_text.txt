[]: Main Force of the Martial Alliance

<> Gyaaah…!

<> Hrk…!

<> Urgh…!

<> Argh…!

"": Acting alliance leader, the ambushing warriors had quickly fled.

"": Some damage was done to the Sabo and the warriors of the Third Dragon Unit, but…

<> Acting alliance leader!

"": ?

"": Pant, pant.

<> Where on earth did you go?!

"": No, no… let us not do this…

<> Was it truly such an important matter that you abandoned the main force?!

page 11

<> Could it be that you went to rescue the Wind Dragon Unit instead of us?

<> With the Great Righteousness War at hand,
//: did you abandon our Third Dragon Unit just to worry about a single squad?

(): Third Dragon Unit Leader. Frankly, it would have been better if these men had died.

(): The warriors brought from each sect — hastily assembled —  
//: have no unified opinion, so they are easier to control.

(): But if these hardened veterans from the Martial Alliance’s center begin to rise up,
//: the entire main force and the subordinates may change their minds as well.

<> In that case, we will immediately withdraw and regroup...

<> Shut up!!

"": No... i-it's just... suddenly...

"": ?

"": What is the matter, Venerable Bohwa?

<> Amitabha...

<> Are the leaders of the Four Dragon Units, 
//: sworn to defend the Martial Alliance, already speaking of retreat?!

page 12

<> Quickly get up and rally the warriors!

"": …?!

(): “Venerable Bohwa”… unexpected.
//: I thought he would be the first to protest.

(): Unlike Hyeonyang, who backed me from the start,

(): if Shaolin’s supreme master, who had maintained neutrality, takes my side...

(): the atmosphere will be settled in an instant.

Sfx: clack clack

Sfx: clack clack

(): However...

(): Venerable Bohwa... Shaolin...

(): Why are they taking my side?

[] : For a thousand years countless sects of the martial world have risen and declined.

[] : Yet I state with certainty: the seat at the summit has never once changed.

[] : Pagoda Forest, Shaolin Temple, Mount Song, Henan.

(): Om ibe ibe iya maha shiriye sabaha. (Buddhist chant.)

[]: Surrounded by stone pagodas enshrining the relics of great monks,  
//: this place truly symbolizes Shaolin’s history and tradition.

Sfx: thud

"": Amitabha. At this rate the demon might awaken.
//: Benefactor, where has the Great Master gone?

[] : One of the Ten Absolutes — the newly risen master, Shaolin’s foremost expert.

<> He has arrived!

"": Oh — indeed, the only one who can restrain that demon is...

page 14

"": Benefactor Yang.

"": He will not let even a moment pass without vigil.

Sfx: step

"": Then I shall enter.

Sfx: whoosh

Sfx: ah ah ah

"": Did I not say, brother?
//: I must return to the Alliance.

[] : Sword Sovereign Yang Tae-hong.

"": If you wish to return, then go.

"": Of course,

"": but then Shaolin will be erased.

Sfx: crack

Sfx: ah

Sfx: ah

Sfx: ah

<> Brother!

"": You said the Celestial Palace would plunge the martial world into chaos,

"": yet all you do is threaten Shaolin to force it to lend strength to the new Acting Alliance Leader?

"": The Celestial Palace is not ours to claim. It belongs to that child.

"": Come to think of it, the order of the Central Plains has endured far too long under the name of the Three Sovereigns.
//: Is that not so?

"": Just have one more drink with me.

"": After all, soon enough
//: we must return to our rightful places.

"": You as Alliance Lord Yang Tae-hong, and I as Cult Leader Ma Tae-pyeong...

"": When will that be?

"": When my son shatters the order of the Three Sovereigns.

page 16

"": Hah...

"": Hah...

"": Say that again.

Sfx: whoom

<> Guhk…!

Sfx: crack

<> Haaarg...!

"": That fake Demonic Cult leader...

"": thinks he can defeat me?
