"" Master, Viscount Deelon has arrived.
"" Tell him to come another day…


<> How are you, Craig?!


() N-no! Master and the Baron are still…!


= G-good day! But Craig is still…


"" What are you doing, you’re in the way.


"" …Who are you?
page 2
"" It’s me! Arnold Deelon, Helena’s younger brother!
() He transformed before I even noticed… as expected.
** Even Barlosh isn’t here…


() This man still doesn’t bother greeting anyone.


"" You really don’t recognize me?
"" It’s truly unfortunate that your memory hasn’t returned yet.


"" Did you come here to check how much of my memory has come back?


"" Of course not! I just wanted to see your face and talk for the first time in a while!
** hahaha
"" For that, your behavior is rather selfish though.


"" Wh-what did you just say…?


"" When a Viscount meets a Countess, he should greet her first…


"" Isn’t that common sense?

"" …
page 3
= C–Cordelia… it’s been a while…


= …Yes…
"" More importantly, I have something personal to discuss.


** Just a formality of greeting...
"" So if I tell you not to greet her, you really won’t?


"" Your way of speaking has changed a bit, hasn’t it? I am your uncle, you know...
 
"" If you’re my uncle, shouldn’t you have come to visit me at least once?


"" I–I was busy with work…
 


"" Since you collapsed, the Abrams family couldn’t run without me, you know.


"" Just get to the point.


"" It’s about your succession… I thought it’d be hard to manage alone, so I came to help.


"" You know well there are many who oppose you, right?
"" If you’re not careful, Jared might even take it away from you.


"" That’s for me to decide. You don’t need to meddle.

 page 4
"" What? Don’t say such cold things…


"" We’re family, aren’t we? No one wishes for your succession more than we do!


"" Family? Who are you talking about?


"" Who else… Helena and me, of course.


"" Right! I also heard about Helena’s matter. It’s unfortunate, but…
"" She’s still your mother, isn’t she?


"" So don’t worry about such a trivial thing…
 
"" Embezzling the family’s funds is a trivial thing?


"" That’s a terrible misunderstanding! I never did such a thing!


() Ugh, seriously! He’s still the head of the house, he should really adjust his attitude…


"" Hey, Viscount Deelon.


() …And right when I thought that!!
page 5
= H-h-how dare you!! I am your—


"" Don’t pretend to be family when we don’t even share a drop of blood.


"" It makes me sick.


= …Ridic…


"" If you’re done talking, then leave.


"" I have no intention of asking for your help.


<> You’ll regret this! Craig!


"" I said I understand, now get out.
page 6
"" W-will everything be alright?


"" What if Viscount Deelon joins the opposition…


"" It doesn’t matter.


"" Do you really think I can’t even protect my title as Count in this remote place?


"" That’s true, but still...


** Hmm...
() …Something just doesn’t sit right with me.


<> Insolent brat!!


"" What are you doing… Arnold!
"" What on earth happened to you?
page 7
"" Do you know what Craig dared to say to me?!


"" He told me not to meddle in his business!
"" “Pretending to be family makes me sick,” that’s what he said!


"" How could he say something so cruel?!

"" And on top of that, he even told me to greet Cordelia…!


"" What did you say?!
"" Unbelievable! To bow my head to a woman bought with money!


"" No matter how I think about it, something’s wrong…


"" Yes, clearly he’s lost his mind!


"" No, this can’t be Craig’s idea alone.


"" That woman must be plotting something for sure.


"" …That Vasquez woman?


"" Don’t you feel it too? He’s completely different from the Craig we knew.


"" True… even without his memories, a person’s core nature shouldn’t change…
page 8
"" He used to be such a womanizer, but after waking up, he’s shown no interest at all.


"" And lately, he’s been strangely concerned about that woman, hasn’t he?
"" The old Craig would never do that.


"" Could it be that staying by his side since he woke up is part of her plan?


"" When someone’s lost their memories, a few lies are enough to make them dance in your    palm.


"" And yet he somehow knows how the funds are being moved...


"" The only explanation is that she’s manipulating him.


"" She plans to use this opportunity to raise Craig up and drive us out,
"" and take the Abrams family for herself.


"" I should’ve thrown away that useless woman who couldn’t even bear an heir long ago!


"" If not for that cursed bloodline, I could’ve chosen a far better woman.
** haa…
"" !
page 9
"" …Then we’ll just have to get rid of her.


"" Eh?


"" There’s no need to keep someone who’s completely useless, is there?


"" We’ll dispose of that troublesome woman and bring in a more suitable lady for us.


** hahaha
"" Sister, what method do you think would be best?


"" She’s such a careless woman after all...


"" Even if she eats something off the ground and gets food poisoning,


"" no one would be surprised.


"" And sometimes a cook might accidentally put in something… they shouldn’t, right?


"" Let’s start preparing at once.
page 10
** haaaa
() I’d love to skip class just for a day.
 
** Eeeek!
** So tired...
() I’m always exhausted after my master’s lessons…


() No! I can’t give up now! This is the chance I’ve worked so hard for!


() I’ll do my best! I can do this!


"" Good day, Countess!
