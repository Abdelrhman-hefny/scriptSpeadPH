“” Iced Americano and an Earl Grey cake to go, right?

“” I’ll help you with the payment.

“” Hope you sell a lot~.

“” Thank you! Please come again~.

# Of course, I failed the last interview,

# And today I’m still working at the café.

“” Seoyeon, good work.

“” Take a short break.

^^ Okay! Then, I’ll go feed Kami.

“” Alright.

[] This is the owner of the place where I work part-time.

[] And this is Kami, a stray cat.

“” Don’t worry, no one’s gonna take it. Eat slowly.

# It has been a few days since I broke up with that guy—

# Fortunately, no major problems happened and I’ve been living well.   .

# I still worry if I did the right thing, or if I was deceived…

# But for now, all I can do is trust him.

“” Kami, did you finish eating?

() And today—

“” Kami! Come again tomorrow~.

() Ah, you are really cute today too..

“” Who are you talking to?

# It was the first time meeting this man again since that day.

“” Is your injury all better now?

“” Ah, yes!

“” That’s such a relief.

 

“” You sure like sweets….

# Can’t eat sweets well. 


page 03

# …Actually,

# “That” thing has been bothering me, but I’ll bring it up later.

“” Seoyeon! The macarons you made earlier are ready,

"" Ah, is it a customer…!

“” The macarons are already done?

“” Can I get them now?

“” Of course, they’re all packed.

^^ Thank you so much! You’re the best, boss!!

“” But, do you know him?

** Whisper 

"" Ah, yes! I called him because I had something to say to him, is that okay?

“” Yeah, that’s fine.

"" Then I’ll go make a call.

“” Okay, come back soon.

“” Um, Hyunwoo.



page 04

“” Do you like macarons?

“” I made them, they might not look perfect, but the taste…

“” Yes,

“” I really, really love them.

# If I knew you like them this much, I wouldn’t have wasted so much time decorating it. 

# Not very skillful.

“” Then, shall we start talking?

“” Seoyeon, what makes you most uncomfortable about “that”?

“” Hmm,

“” First, I can’t live a normal life.

“” I nearly died too.

“” Sometimes I wonder if I was the real problem.

# What I regretted most was,

# When people said I was crazy,

# I couldn’t even strongly deny it.

# Because deep down, I thought so too—.

“” …

“” —Seoyeon,

“” I told you I was confused once too.

“” People said I was strange,

“” I thought so too,

“” And I spent every day just crying.

# Then one day, the one who comforted me as I cried was—

“” Are you okay, child.

“” Your voice is sorrowful.

“” Child,

“” Don’t throw your life away,

# And just like that, suddenly,



page 06

# I realized that those things aren’t just scary existences to avoid.

# Even if some might call it resignation or rationalization—

“” …Yes, I’m fine now.

“” It just means I get to see a wider world than others.’

“” Once I understood it this way, my heart felt at ease.

“” After that, I learned how to coexist with them,

“” And eventually, more people began to accept me as I am—.

“” So Seoyeon,

“” Don't blame yourself.

“” There’s nothing wrong with you.

“” ....

“” ...

“” ….Yes.



page 07

<> Since it’s come to this, I’ll give it my best!

** Might as well go for it!

# After hearing his story, the anxiety that kept clinging to me eased.

# And I decided to set aside my doubts about him for now.

# I don’t know, whether what he said was true or not—

** Nothing bad happened—

# But I couldn’t just stay still like before.

“” So what should we do the next time we meet? 

“” Should we try going to a place with lots of ghosts first?

** Huh

# Straight into practice?!

“” I have to go now for today, so let’s set another time to meet.

“” The place can be around the mountain or its base,

“” Somewhere bright enough and not too far.

“” —Namsan?



page 08

<> Namsan!

** Gasp! Did I just suggest hiking with my own mouth!

<> That’s perfect!

^^ This is my first time going to Namsan! I’m so excited!

# Welcome! 
# ~Stairs of Hell~ 

<> Wait, why do the stairs never end?

"" Seoyeon, are you oka…?

“” Yes?

# Fine

“” ...Oh my God,

"" If I’d known it was this hellish training course, I wouldn’t have babbled about being excited.

^^ Oh my, students ! Hang in there~.

^^ Ah, it’s so nice seeing young people like this!



page 09

# At the time, I didn’t know.

# That the scenery of Namsan, which always looked peaceful,

# Would appear completely different this time—,


# To be continued
