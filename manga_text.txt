“”: Immortal King.  

“”: I will never live as your slave again.  

“”: ...Come in.  

“”: Lady Siana!  

[]: The Vow of Rebellion — Andrew Weaver  

“”: You look beautiful as always today!  

“”: Enough with the small talk, Mr. Andrew.  
//: Did you find out who the new head of the Varcoslach Clan is?  

“”: Of course.  

“”: The opponent is a true blood vampire.  

“”: His name is “Heinz.”  


page 2   

“”: Even if he’s true blood,
//: how could he possibly swallow up an entire vampire clan?  

 

ST: Haa…

“”: W-Well, that part is still…  

<> What was that?!  

<> Lady! Your horns are showing, horns!!!  

“”: …I told you already.  

“”: My skill, “Trajectory Observation,” might be like a clairvoyant ability,  

“”: but to examine things more closely, I need to upgrade it with Karma….  

“”: Enough! I don’t need excuses.  

(): Tch…!  

ST: Just give me the data, then talk.  

(): No matter how good the long-range surveillance skill is,  

(): without intel, all I get is a blurry view!  

“”: Anyway, it’s good that the new lord of Varcoslach isn’t of pure blood.
// That makes him easier to take down.  

“”: Will you personally handle it, Lady Siana?  

“”: As if I would.  


page 3   

“”: The strongest vampire clan on the continent,  

“”: “Yufersh,” will wage a conquest war.  

“”: You gathered the data fast.  

“”: Of course. 
//: It was a special order from the Lord in a long time.  

“”: I mobilized all of Heterosis’s resources!  

(): Metal properties,  

(): how to grip a hammer, and real combat.  

(): I can’t fully grasp it from just reading the materials but…  

(): As expected, dwarves are dwarves.  

ST: Oh ho…  

ST: Hmhm!  

(): Howard gets it right away, doesn’t he?  

(): Once the teleportation cooldown ends, 
//: I’ll send him to Hubert Trading Company’s workshop.  


page 4   

“”: Oh right,
//: there’s one more thing to report to the Lord.  

“”: What is it?  

“”: We found signs that the Vancheon Society is interacting with other factions.  

“”: Other factions?  

“”: I plan to dig a little deeper into their identities.  

(): The Vancheon Society… what are they scheming?  

(): …Well, there’s no rush.  
//: As long as we handle it thoroughly.  

(): Time is on our side.  

(): While my personas trained and grew for ten months,  

(): only a single month passed on Earth.  

“”: Yes, I’ll be going now!  

(): A child?  


page 5   

“”: May I ask what business brings you here…?  

“”: I’ve come to see Mullo.  

“”: Lead the way.  

() H-How dare you speak so casually to Lord Mullo…!  

“”: Did you have an appointment in advance?  

“”: Do I need to have one?  
//: Just tell him Briki is here, he’ll understand.  

“”: What an insolent thing to say.  
//: I’ll inform Lord Mullo, so return at once.  

“”: That won’t be necessary.  

“”: Welcome.  

“”: Lord Varcoslach.  

“”: It’s been a while, Mullo.  

“” L-Lord Varcoslach?!  

“”: Then could this person be the founder of the clan—  

“”: You mean… pure blood “Lord Varcoslach” himself?!  


page 6   

“”: I deeply apologize for not welcoming you properly, Lord Varcoslach.  
//: Frigia must have stepped out…

“”: Hey now! I told you to call me Briki.  

“”: “Varcoslach” sounds way too stiff.  

“”: Yes, Lord Briki.  

(): This is troublesome.  

(): There should’ve been at least twenty years left before the scheduled visit.  

(): For you to suddenly show up like this…  

ST: Hmmm…  

“”: But something’s really strange.  

“”: That kid at the door earlier.  

“”: His essence hasn’t changed, and yet,  
//: there are too many incomprehensible changes.  


page 7   

“”: He didn’t even recognize his own master.  

“”: I-Is that so?  

ST: I… I was just…  

“”: Don’t try to make excuses.  

“”: You’re the same.  

(): …I can’t fight against Lord Briki.  
//: Nor do I want to.  

(): Of all times, this had to happen while Lord Heinz is away…  

“”: He definitely carries my blood, but…  

ST: Can it really change this much?  

“”: Well, anyway…  

“”: Where is the one who made you like this?  

() You knew everything and were just testing us!  

(): So this is how it ends…  

“”: …He’s stepped away for now.  

“”: Then I suppose I can stay here while I wait?  

ST: I didn’t really prepare a place to rest.  

“”: Of course.  


page 8   

“”: ...  

(): This is truly fascinating.  

(): I’ve always dreamed of it.  

(): Strengthening the bloodline through evolution and passing down a superior lineage… 
//: If that were truly possible,  

(): we vampires could step into the light.  

OT: And yet…  

(): When I woke up from my slumber, someone had actually opened that possibility.  

(): Let’s see.  

(): You admirable descendant,  

(): and the bold rebel who dared defy my blood…
