"": Your Grace. A messenger sent by the Paladin is requesting an audience.

SFX: Knock knock

"": Ruv?

"": Yes. He said he urgently needs permission for something.

"": Tell him I’m transferring full authority over the site to him, so he doesn’t need to request permission every time.

//: He can just report to me afterward once everything’s done.

"": Yes, understood.

"": You’re granting permission without even hearing the details?

//: You must trust him a lot.

"": Of course.

"": Ruv is my oldest and closest friend.

"": And… you must also know this.

//: The weight that comes with the name of a Paladin.

"": Ruv will be the most helpful friend when the time comes for me to rule this country.

"": Well, I also enjoy just having him around.

SFX: Chuckle

"": He’s the kind of man who’s stayed in love with one woman for years, with that face of his.




page 2 

(): As I thought… What I saw in Cardillon’s attitude back then wasn’t an act, it was genuine.

"": More importantly, Delilah.

//: Why did you send the carriage back empty last time?

"": I thought something had happened.

OT: Since that day, Kirion and I have continued to meet.

[]: He contacted me several times, summoning me to the Senilo mansion…

[]: …with a confident attitude that showed no fear at all.

"": I sent the best carriage so you could come comfortably.

"": Your Grace, please don’t keep sending carriages without notice. It’s troubling.

"": Why? Did Giyorn say something?

"": Lord Giyorn isn’t exactly an oblivious man, you know.

"": Why does Lord Kirion keep calling for you?

[]: I thought Giyorn was dense, but surprisingly, he could read the situation.




page 3 

"": Your Grace must have really liked my singing.

//: Don’t worry. Nothing bad will happen.

[]: I suppose it’s uncomfortable for him, with his mistress being constantly summoned by another man and all.

OT: In the first place, the reason Giyorn took me in wasn’t so different.

OT: He used his status and power to snatch away someone else’s patron’s mistress.

OT: He must fear the same thing would happen to him.

"": If Giyorn’s possessiveness bothers you, you can just leave him.

"": Your Grace, you truly don’t consider my position at all, do you?

"": So you sent my carriage back just because of something so trivial?

"": …Are you angry?

"": Of course not. If anything, it’s amusing.

"": You really are something.

"": Just like a woman bold enough to demand my time.

[]: Arrogant, as if he’s standing above all things, but it didn’t feel out of place.




page 4 

[]: Born of the Pope’s bloodline, he was raised as an archbishop from birth.

//: This man carries both confidence and pride that he will one day succeed the Papal throne.

[]: To show stubbornness or pride against such a person would be foolish.

[]: Meeting Giyorn made me realize my position even more clearly.

OT: For now, he’s a man blinded by love who acts like he’d give me his very life,

OT: but in the end, my place is merely that of a passing mistress.

OT: I’ll live a life like floating duckweed, never knowing when I’ll sink again.

OT: Even the position I’ve fought tooth and nail to reach…

OT: …is one where I must bow to those higher than me just to survive.

[]: No matter how much I polish my looks or refine my skills…

[]: …if I lack noble birth, I can never truly stand at the top.




page 5 

OT: Then….

"": Come to think of it, a friend once told me this.

"": Delilah, you’re a dangerous woman.

"": I wonder what he meant by that?

//: Did he mean no man could handle you?

"": I somewhat agree. You do have a dangerously alluring scent about you.

"": A woman too much even for a man of the Sentinel family to handle…

"": Then what about me?

"": …Your Grace, I’d say you’re the dangerous one.

//: You hold the key that could change my entire life, dangerous, but irresistible.

OT: That’s right.

OT: If I must live as someone’s mistress, then I’ll become the mistress of the next Pope.

OT: The mistress of the highest man in the land.




page 6 

[]: I’ll stand beside the one they bow their heads to.

[]: What I can’t achieve with my own power, I’ll fill it using another’s.

OT: I’ll become the one and only woman who’s been with both

OT: the Sentinel family and the Pope himself.

(): I can’t sleep…

OT: The question that’s been clouding my head was simpler than I thought.

[]: Because I liked you, and I wanted to live with you.

OT: That answer was so simple and clear, it almost made things awkward.




page 7 

(): It’s been what… three months now? Since I started living with Rublier?

[]: If you asked whether it’s been unbearable, not really.

[]: Sometimes it’s awkward being suddenly so close,
[]: but I appreciated how he’d listen and help me solve my problems.

OT: To me, a husband is…

OT: …someone who lives under the same roof and shares daily life,

OT: who’ll have and raise the heir to Del Mare with me,

OT: someone I can trust.

[]: Can Rublier really be that person?




page 8 

(): I don’t know… I can’t find a clear answer.

OT: But at some point,

OT: I started feeling uncomfortable bringing up divorce in front of Rublier.

[]: The person who looked at me with the saddest eyes in the world at the word “divorce.”

OT: I didn’t want to hurt someone who expressed such unconditional affection any longer.

[]: If Rublier really had loved me all this time,

[]: and if my childhood memories were all just my misunderstanding…

OT: Then how were you feeling…
OT: …when you saw me openly avoiding you?

SFX: Murmur

"": …There’s no point in worrying, huh…

ST: Haa…




page 9 

"": I should just go to bed.

"": …Huh?

"": Just now…

"": …I feel like something was watching from over there.

"": Was it just my imagination…?

"": No, no! There’s definitely something there!!!

SFX: Thud!

(): The gaze was one thing, but that strange energy I felt along with it…

(): I’ve never felt anything like it before, but I’m certain.

"": Whatever’s outside… It’s definitely not human.

"": It’s different from a ghost, much more evil….

SFX: Shiver

SFX: Tremble…

(): I-I have to tell someone!

SFX: Dash




page 11 

(): I have to tell Rublier that something unholy has entered this house—

"": Kyaaahh!!!
