"": Please check for broken—
"": Ugh…
"": I am arresting you for illegal modification of AINIMAL for criminal use—
// Enough evidence is already there.
"": Jerry,
"": Who’s the next target for illegal modification?
"": It will now display.

page 2
"": Chilli Pepper…
"": The evolved AINIMAL,
// huh.
<> ?!
"": Chili Pepper?
"": I’m having chills…
"": …Isn’t it because they’re here?
"": How rude, there’s no way I’m letting out cold air in the hospital, you know?
"": How beautiful…
// You are truly an “Angel in White”...!
"": How about spewing some flames out your mouth if you’re feeling cold?
"": I will never forget you, the angel that is you!
"": Mr. Shirogane…!
"": Well then, the next surgery will be on Tuesday.

page 3
"": It has been arranged by this beautiful angel in white for me!
"": Huh?
<> Why are you deciding it by yourself?!
// We haven’t even gathered funds for the surgery cost!
"": Oh, you don’t need to worry about financial stuff.
// I already paid for the surgery.
<> Wha-
"": Your grandfather is now safe. (is this grandpa or uncle)
"": I want to fight you seriously—
// So consider this a selfish wish of mine, and just take it.
<> …!
"": Well then, adie!
OT: Mr. Shirogane is so cool…
"": …When the surgery ends, Grandpa will also be transferred to the general ward.
"": Then, for now, we just need to earn for our medical and living expenses.
"": Well, that’s true, but—
// It’s like we’re playing into his hands, or something…
"": Hm?
"": Speak of the devil, he’s calling…

page 4
"": Sorry for disturbing your meal!
"": What’s up, comrades, are you guys getting enough rest?!
<> If you just didn’t call then we’d get enough!
"": Well, you’re a very kind person after all, so I thought that you might be worried about the money.
"": Welp, it’s a piece of cake for me. Don’t mind it.
"": You liar.
"": You were even crying worried about if you did something out of line.
"": Wha- You little!
// Kiba-
"": I can’t show off to them if they knew about that!
"": A-anyways!
"": The only thing I want is for him to get well and fight you for real!
"": So I’m thinking of giving you some advice.
"": Advice?
"": The Synchro Drive you activated at the end of the match—
"": From what I saw, it seemed like you were just copying our elegant movements.

page 5
"": But normally, you should prepare a more elegant pose in advance!
St: Just look at this level of perfection!
<> That’s just your hobby, right?
"": It’s not about just posing randomly.
// Joint attacks can dramatically increase your mobility by linking your movements.
"": And to be able to use that, you need to have a Tune Score—
// The link density for the both of you.
"": Your score is still low, so your power leap is still small.
"": Then what should I do to increase that Tune Score?
"": It depends on the person, but—
"": Me and Kiba improved it by cuddling and sleeping together.
<> Wha…?!
"": If your score increases, you’ll have more techniques you can use, and your chances of winning will increase!
"": But, 
"": I don’t recommend always using joint attacks.
"": Why? It’s strong, isn’t it?
"": It comes with its own risks.
"": I and Kiba can do it once a day, or twice a day at maximum output.
// If we go past that—

page 6
"": We’ll overheat and we won’t be able to move.
// This is what we call “Heat Lock”.
"": By the way, we took 2 days to recover from that.
"": That long…?
"": … But if you can use it well, you’ll have an advantage.
"": …
"": So you want me to be ready to use it before our match?
"": That’s Right!
// I’m wrapping it up here for now, I wish you guys all the best!
"": Ah- wait…
// Shirogane, Kiba, um… About Grandpa’s hospital bills…
"": You really saved us.
"": T-thank..

page 7
"": …He hung up.
// That maaaaaaaaaaannnn!!
St: Saying thanks to me violates my policy.
St: You’re just so stubborn…
"": Well then,
"": We need to cuddle and sleep together for our tune score to go up, right…
"": K-Kaito…?
<> It’s for grandpa!
<> Kyaaaa!!
<> Come on! Don’t run away!
<> Are you for real?! Return to your senses, Kaito!
<> Even I would rather cuddle a woman!
<> ?!
<> Wha… What’s with you?!
