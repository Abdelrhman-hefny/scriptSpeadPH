"": We've met much earlier than expected.
//: Seems like a bond has been formed between two celestial beings!

[]: As a reward, you will receive an Ex Guaranteed Board Ticket.

:: Y-You know this is all just a joke, right...? Right..?
//: Uh, yeah??

[]: A white-grade character completely trusts the user.

[]: You are in a state of 100% assimilation with a white-grade character.

"": Jokes are fine, don't worry.

[]: Hidden skill <Single Strike Pierce> ready to use.

"": I'm just joking too.

page 4

"": Single Strike Pierce.

:: Waaah-?! Are you crazy? How can this be considered a joke!!

:: Don’t just stand there, help me!!

:: Are you doing this because you want to see the whole dungeon turn to dust?!

page 5

"": Bulwark Cascade!

"": Waaah, a mythic-level barrier magic circle
breaking from a sword strike?!!!

"": Mana, pour in even more mana!!

"": Hold your shield properly! If you don't want to be vaporized!!

"": They should be fine, right?
//: I purposely held back some strength.

"": Seeing them make such a fuss, it seems they appear to be fine.
//: Then, this general will take his leave.

page 6

"": The shield... is....

"": I thought the whole dungeon was evaporating...!

"": How much is this worth...!

"": No, this is crazy… Is this a bug...?

[]: Please choose your reward!

"": How come <Heavenly Martial Body-Iv.3>, <Single Strike Pierce> appear again as rewards?

"": That's great! Since I have Heavenly Martial Body, this is a good chance to get Single Strike Pierce!

"": That's true, but.......

"": What if,

page 7

"": What would happen if you selected Heavenly Martial Body again?

:: Eek... What do you mean by that, master?!

"": Even getting a level 3 talent once is extremely rare,

//: and getting the exact same talent twice? That's truly beating odds that shouldn't even exist.

"": Right...?

"": If you've beaten such extreme odds, there should be some sort of reward, don't you think?

"": Maybe Heavenly Martial Body gets enhanced...

"": Or its level goes up...!

"": H-Hey, that definitely sounds reasonable...!

"": And I did draw Choi Chung-gyeong again so easily,

"": So I feel like the energy of the universe is gathering around me!

"": Okay, I feel it.

page 8

:: This goes to Heavenly Martial Bodyyy!!!

[]: <Heavenly Martial Body-Iv.3> is a complete, ultimate talent. Further enhancement is impossible.

"": Huh?

:: W-Wait... N-Nooooo—!!!
//: Let me choose again, pllease—!!

:: My Single Strike Pierce!!!!

[]: Reward selection has been canceled. The remaining rewards have been automatically acquired.

[]: Skill <Single Strike Pierce> has been acquired.

:: Wow...
//: Thank you… Universe...!

:: I will never gamble like this again…!

page 9

[]: For the first time, an attempt to enhance <Talent> has been made.

[]:: As a reward, a <special item> has been stocked in Winry's Point Shop.

[]:: The ultimate form of talent

"": It temporarily allows you to handle talents at the highest mastery level...?

"": No,

//: It's not permanent? What kind of prize is that...!

:: Hey, what's with you!

:: How do you know how to use the 'Concept Sever' skill?!

:: C-Could it be… that you got that skill through the road...?

PR/N: No Idea what road is i checked the [names] to find nun

"": Concept Sever...? What is that?
//: Are you talking about Single Strike Pierce?

:: You’re using it without knowing what it even is?!
//: We could have all died, you jerk!!

"": I-I'm sorry....

"": Hmph, really.

"": I'll explain briefly.

page 10

"": 'Concept Sever',

"": means a level where you can momentarily break the system of the universe.

"": For example, like when you tried to blow up our hideout...
//: You’re basically splitting space.

"": Even items with options that can’t be destroyed can be destroyed.

:: ...?!

"": An example is the 'King of All Diseases' that we created.

"": You can't even imagine how dangerous and immense the power is.

"": Others, even after training for thousands of years, can't even find the clue to Concept Sever,

"": and Concept Sever is a power that even gods tremble in fear of.

page 11

"": This is a power that can defy the laws, concepts, and systems of the universe that have been maintained for tens of thousands or even hundreds of millions of years!

"": You can easily get such power as a skill,
//: and once your rank and level go up, you can use it at will? There's no scam like this.

(): Wow… If I hadn't gotten this, it would have been a big problem.

(): Thank you… Oh Universe...!

"": Um... Anyway, you passed this trial too, right?

:: You passed before you even started, you jerk!

st: Sigh...

"": If you want anything, just say it. Within reason, I'll grant it.

"": Then, please look at this.

"": Hmm?

"": Oh, this is a Wireless Realm Warp Scroll, isn't it?

"": It's not something you see often… Wow, something amazing comes out every time.

"": Do you know about the Wireless Realm?

"": Yeah, I know about it.
//: I once went there too.

page 12

:: Oh, really? What kind of place is that?!

st: What's up with you?!

"": It's a place where the strong people of the entire universe gather with the sole purpose of becoming stronger!

"": The Wireless Realm is a place where war, violence, blood, and desire endlessly swirl.

"": Wow....

"": If you tear up the Warp Scroll, you can go there anytime right now, but...
//: I'll give you just one piece of advice.

"": Don't go.

page 13

"": If you go there in your current state, you will definitely die!

:: ...?!
