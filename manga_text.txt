[]: Southern manor of the Alliance

"": These filthy orthodox bastards, 
//: how long do you intend to keep this busy man waiting?

"": Yabultak, calm yourself.

"": Move your head. Bald bastard, shiny-headed bastard, 
//: flashing light off your forehead bastard.

ST: Hehe.

"": Hey, Seo Hopil, you bastard. 
//: Wipe that frown off your face. Is the world collapsing?

Sfx: Sob sob

"": My sect… my sect was annihilated! Ugh..!

"": And what do you expect me to do about it? You are ruining my appetite.
//:  In life, sects may be destroyed.

"": Yabultak, close your mouth and sit.

"": Yes!

Sfx: Step

Sfx: Glance

"": Setting that aside, Yeha, 
//: which of the Four Dragon Units would you like to join?

"": I do not know.

"": Normally, the champion would apply to the Azure Dragon Unit, 
//: which is in the rear, safest, and maintains the Alliance’s order…




page 2

"": I have no interest, but if one has skill, he should step forward. 
//: Why retreat? Strange.

"": As expected of you… no, you’re remarkable.

"": Azure Dragon, Flame Dragon, Flying Dragon, all fine…

"": But avoid Wind Dragon.

"": Rescuing hostages, infiltrating enemy lines… Wind Dragon only faces death.

"": In the past ten years, the Azure Dragon Leader changed once, 
//: while the Wind Dragon Leader died twice.

"": Moreover, even the few members left were all slain by the Demonic Alliance’s attack.

"": The Wind Dragon’s sword is tireless—rescuing the weak and destroying the wicked.

ST: !

"": Thus, the Wind Dragon Unit is burdened with endless work.

Sfx: Step

Sfx: Step

"": Because the martial world holds far too much that must be set right.




page 3

"": The Wind Dragon Unit is the hardest of the Four Dragons.

"": In recent years, weakened further by the Acting Lord’s suppression, 
//: they must endure harsher training and more perilous missions.

"": One may die.

"": Avoiding it is only natural. 
//: It wouldn’t even matter if no one applied.

"": However…

"": I know well that I am not alone.

"": Will you not join me in Wind Dragon?

(): Ah…

(): If the goal were to simply gather members, 
//: it would have been easy to lie and offer the easy path.

"": But if you must strain yourself to enter the Alliance, do not apply to Wind Dragon.

(): Instead, I declare openly, to share even death together, the meaning of Daedo Moomoon (大道無門).

#: *Daedo Moomoon (大道無門): There is no set path or method to reach great enlightenment or truth.




page 4

(): From the very beginning, that was the feeling I sensed. Though the atmosphere differs greatly…

"": …It is not right.

"": I shall change it.

(): A strangely familiar feeling.

"": I will.

"": I will join Wind Dragon.

Sfx: Sparkle

Sfx: Sparkle

(): That is admirable.

"": Unlike the other Dragon Units, which have only just begun to replenish warriors,

"": With the support of those who achieved excellent results in the Martial Tournament,

"": The Wind Dragon Unit, already prepared,

"": Shall stand at the vanguard of the Alliance.




page 5

(): Tch.

"": Tell us the word.

(): Wind Dragon! Those bastards moved first! 
//: They swept up all the promising warriors from the tournament.

(): A chance to leave a deep impression on the Acting Lord…!!

(): While everyone was panicking after Jegal Mundung’s fall, 
//: he alone prepared for what came next…

"": Very well. First,

"": I demote Wind Dragon from a full unit to a squad, excluding them from the Four Dragon Units.

Sfx: Boom




page 6

"": !!

"": Jegal Mundung sent all the existing Wind Dragon members away as couriers. //: Even the few remaining were annihilated, stopping the Demonic Alliance’s raid.

Sfx: Sweep

"": So you gathered new members, it seems…

"": One… two… three… including the leader, eight?

"": The minimum requirement to maintain a unit is two squads of five—ten in total.

"": Even at minimum, you are two short. //:Surely you can handle such arithmetic?

"": That is…

"": With many new members, training will be difficult. 
//: Henceforth, recruitment is forbidden.

"": I cannot accept that.

Sfx: Leap up

"": Did I ask for your opinion?




page 7

"": The vanguard will be taken by the Azure Dragon Unit. I cannot entrust it to a mere squad.

(): Haha, Wind Dragon, of course…

(): Wind Dragon is…

"": Today’s meeting ends here.

Sfx: Step

"": Acting Lord!

Sfx: Step

(): You should stay out of this.

[]: Secret chamber of the Martial Alliance

<> Kekeke! That cunning brat, I hear he gathers those who should be cast aside, //:and turns them into his allies!

<> And for him to visit at such a busy time… //: is it that he seeks help?




page 8

(): It is Tang Joha, one of the Ten Absolutes. There is little I can offer.

(): However…

"": Master, please return to Sichuan first.

"": That is why I have come.

<> Fool…! Kuhak!! 
//: Gaaaah!!!

<> With the Demonic Alliance before us, where do you think you are sending me?! To win, even this old man must…

"": We shall win without Master.

"": And this disciple will not be content with that alone.

"": What do you mean?

"": I will annihilate the Demonic Alliance.




page 9

"": If I defeat the Demonic Lord, they will retreat to Yunnan.

Sfx: Shanshi

Sfx: Sichuan

"": Please deal with them as they flee. //:There is no one but you, Master of the Ten Absolutes, to entrust this role.

"": That man once forced even the Ten Absolutes to kneel. 
//: Do you understand what that means?

"": Yes, I do.

"": But I shall prevail.

"": Good. Then I will go to Sichuan, as you ask.

Sfx: Creak

"": But remember this.

"": I too will not be satisfied with mere victory.

"": Yes, yes, this time we shall drive the Demonic Alliance out of the Central Plains once and for all—

<> Fool! That is not it!

<> Victory or destruction may come later.




page 10

<> What this old man desires is…

"": For you to return alive and unharmed. Only then will I be satisfied.

"": …

"": …

"": You have returned.

"": Yes. As you said, the Demonic Alliance remains in Kunlun.

"": And the warriors requested for reinforcement?

"": Three days? Perhaps four? That should be enough to gather them.

"": …Good. Then set out once more.

"": …

<> Do you think I'm an idiot?!

"": Zhuge Wen-deng has a backer.

"": Huh?

"": Zhuge Wen-deng grew the merchant guild by distributing drugs.

"": But no matter which record I searched, I could not find who made the drugs.

"": It looks like the Zhuge Family is involved.

"": The Final Righteousness War is at hand; we should focus on the Sado Clan. //:Isn’t Zhuge Wen-deng’s backer something for later?

"": We will move separately.

"": I take the Sado Clan,

"": you take care of Zhuge Wen-deng’s backer.

"": You’re looking a bit sharper; I’m not used to it.

"": Gak, were you always this clever?

"": But I have a keen nose for smells.

page 12

"": Gak, you... you demoted Wind Dragon to a squad,
//: and sent Elder Tang Joha back to Sichuan, did you not?

"": Seeing as you even sent me outward...

"": It seems you want to remove all trustworthy people from the Final Righteousness War.

"": You, surely…

"": For the sake of righteousness.

"": Damn it.

Sfx: step

Sfx: step

"": How pathetic. Pathetic weakling.

"": You are exactly the Gak I know.

<> Commence the attack!

"": That kid is the Acting Leader?

"": And he’s ordering troops as soon as he returns.
//: Do the elders already know of this?

"": I don’t know, he gives no time to rest.

[] : Azure Dragon Leader, Cheonghyeo Jin-in

"": The Murim Alliance has truly reached its limit.
//: It is unjust that the military lord was locked in the prison, yet this greenhorn who has never known real war...

"": Oh my, the gossip~

Sfx: clack clack

[] : Flying Dragon Leader, Ho-ran

"": That Sichuan Branch Chief defended Sichuan in Guizhou from the Sado Clan Lord —

<> Flying Dragon’s intelligence is all talk now. What right have you to open your mouth?
//: If Flying Dragon’s intelligence had done its duty, would the Alliance’s gate have been ravaged by the Sado Clan?

<> What did you say? Ha, really. What has Azure Dragon done in all this time?

"": Wind Dragon is nowhere to be seen.

"": I always disliked how they strutted like they alone walked the path of righteousness....

Sfx: thud

"": You summoned us, Acting Leader. From now on the Azure Dragon will guard you safely.

"": Flying Dragon Leader Ho-ran, I respectfully answer the call.

"": Flame Dragon Leader Hwang Bogo here. I will fight with my life.

(): Old faces I haven’t seen in a while.

(): Ho-ran, Hwang Bogo, and Cheonghyeo.

(): They joined the Murim Alliance around the same time as I did.

(): When I became leader, they knelt and congratulated while rubbing their palms together.

(): Behind my back they nattered about me — that was their pleasure.

(): Those who rub their palms at authority then turn and spit are trash
//: who survived by watching Zhuge Wen-deng’s mood.

page 16

(): The fact that such men became unit leaders is a sign the Murim Alliance was rotten.

(): But I do not intend to kill them now.

"": I only called you to pay respects, yet you all are willing to risk your lives.

<> Thank you. Follow me. I will give you the chance to take the vanguard.

Sfx: ta

(): Pierce, stab... at least say something before we go.

(): From now on these men will be the first to risk their lives in the coming battle with the Sado Clan.

(): Even if they survive, they will be so traumatized they'll leave the field themselves.

(): This is the first step.

(): Damn, I was complacent. I tried to trap the wind in my hand.

(): Expecting them to stay put was naive.

(): Nanggung Ye-na.
