"": Juwoon…!

"": …I’ve been searching for you all this time,

"": There’s so much I want to say… 

//: but first I have to say this.

<> …!

"": I really missed you, Yun Seon-ah.

 

"": You could have just written me off as dead…

<> ?!

"": Why did you come all the way out here?




page 2

<> …Yun Seon-ah, you don’t have to struggle like this!!

<> I know—how kind you are…!

<> I don’t want to hear it!!

<> If you keep getting in the way of my revenge like this…!

<> Don’t ever come looking for me again!!!

"": Wha…

<> How can you say that…!

"": …What is that sound?




page 3

"": No way…!

(): It’s Master’s aura!

<> Once we take this old man down, the tide of battle will turn!!

<> Kill him by any means!!

<> How dare you…!

"": ...?!

<> Gahk…!

<> Ugh!

<> Gahk…!

(): Damn, I shouldn’t have tried using a tasking technique while injured…!

(): If I don’t get to 'Un-gi Jo-sik' quickly…




page 6

<> Die, Ma Sae-pung!!

<> Guhk...?!

<> At last, your disgusting presence ends!!!

<> The Hwangseok Sect will take a great new step forward!!

<> Bu… Neungpa…!

(): …From that day on, was fate already sealed?

"": We are martial men, not politicians;

"": State affairs are none of our concern, so Hwasan Sect will abstain from this matter.




page 7

"": …What?!

<> Sect Master, this is for the good of the country!

//:  I wish to join forces with the Odaesan Sword and share in the nation’s glory!

"": Do you value ‘glory stained with blood on your hands’?

"": Isn’t saving innocent civilians amidst war a more honorable deed?

"": …Ma Sect Master, I understand your position.

"": Then Hwangseok Sect declares it will not take part in the Ryeo Country subjugation…

<> !!

"": Shall we relay that directly to the royal court?

<> Se-Sect Master! Shouldn’t you consider us as well?!

<> If this marks us in the eyes of the court… 

// how can we walk the streets under the name Hwangseok Sect?!

"": …




page 8

"": …If you do not wish to see blood,

//: How about Hwangseok Sect only take part in operations that prevent meaningless slaughter?

"": If so, the royal court won’t make a huge issue of it.

"": What do you think of this course, Ma Sect Master?

"": Haa….

"": …Then so be it. Do as you propose.

OT: Yes… if it could not be avoided anyway….

OT: However….

<> What are you doing right now!!




page 10

<> …Please, Sect Master, have some restraint!!!

<> This is war!!

<> In war, what is righteousness and what is ideal?!

//: Slaughter! War is nothing but killing and being killed.

<> Didn’t you foresee and permit this from the start?!

"": I... I...!!

<> Stop this nauseating pretense of virtue!!!

"": Then I shall be leaving!

(): …Yes, it’s all my fault. I led them astray,

(): I gave them false hopes…




page 11

(): It’s my fault!!

"": Ah… ahh….

"": …?

"": Ah….

"": Sa…ve… me…

"": Please… save me….

<> Alright!! I’ll take you to the physician right now!!

"": Ah….

"": To steal even the eyes of a child…

<> I… I will surely save you… I’m sorry, I am so sorry…!

"": Don’t worry, child. I’ll help you get vengeance…




page 12

(): So… first, live. You must live…!

<> …Don’t thrash about in vain, you dying old man…!

(): C-could this energy be…?

"": Yu I-jeong… On Seok-ah…

"": I’m sorry I didn’t finish your vengeance for you…!

"": A ministerial execution…?
