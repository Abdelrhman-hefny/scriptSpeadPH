[]: The only daughter of House Halbern.

[]: Arellin Sigria Halbern.

[]: The Arellin we knew,

[]: was always the quiet child sitting in the corner of our playgroup.

[]: At first, everyone treated Arellin according to her status as a duke’s daughter...

"": They say no one even knows who her mother is?

"": I heard even Duke Halbern treats her like she doesn’t exist....

"": Even the maids of the ducal estate look down on her, apparently.

[]: Hearing those rumors, the children

# gradually ignored her, or pretended not to see her.

[]: One would expect her to be angry at the children’s disregard and belittling attitude, but—

page 2

[]: Even with such treatment,

# She always smiled.

# Foolishly.

# So of course, we thought today, too,

# would be no different...

"": Why is everyone quiet?

page 3

"": Answer me.

# This is...

# not the Arellin we knew.

"": Why’s no one talking?

page 4

"": Lady.

"": Y-Yes...!

"": Name.

"": I-I’m Nadeli.

"": Your father’s title.

"": A viscount.

"": Lady Nadeli, do you know?

"": This is just a friendly gathering, but....

"": At an ordinary social party, you wouldn’t even be allowed to speak to me.

"": I appreciate your advice. However—

"": I never gave you permission to advise me.

"": Advice from someone without power is nothing but a nuisance...

"": Do you know what it means to commit a sin with words?

"" Sob...

"" Sob, hic…

page 5

"" Mooooom! Aaahhh!

"" Mooooom! Aaahhh!

"": ....

() Just kids like this...

() Why did I ever want to be friends with them so badly?

""<> Excuse me. Might I bring out some more tea and refreshments…

page 6

"" Sob... hic...

"": Did something happen?

"": No...

"": I was simply letting Lady Nadeli in on a truth a bit early.

"": That in this world, nothing gets solved just by crying.

"": ...Pardon?

"": I enjoyed the tea party.

"": Then, I’ll be taking my leave first.

() …So much for making friends.

() I just go home.

page 7

"": The Sky Tower is coming....

[]: The sacred ground of mages, the Sky Tower.

[]: The central stronghold of the Mage Tower, and the homeland of all magicians.

[]: No one knew if it existed in the skies, in the cosmos...

[]: or if it truly existed at all.

() For the Sky Tower...

() to formally declare its intent to visit the Albrecht Empire.

page 8

() It must be because of the Charit incident.

() First, I’ll have to request a meeting with the Tower Master.

"": Lord Mehen.

"": I’ve organized the documents for the subjugation support requests.

"": These monster hunts really don’t seem to end lately.

"": Maybe the monsters came out for a spring picnic.

"": It’s already summer.

"": Well, late spring at least.

"": By the way, this is the first reinforcement request from the northern fortress.

"": It seems the situation is growing more serious by the day.

"": ...It really does.

"": ...Leaving behind his house and children to bury himself in the North,

"": just what does His Grace think he’s doing....

() Maybe I should’ve waited for a lighter mood before bringing up news of the Duke.

page 9

"": And what’s this about the Crown Prince’s special commission?

"": It’s a covert request currently being handled mainly by the 1st Order of Knights.

"": The reward is good, so I hear the knights are highly motivated.

** So that guy made a profit off this special commission.

"": A covert request?

** Woohoo!!

() Looks like Pession is up to some odd scheme again, hardly befitting a crown prince.

** Not interested.

"": Ah, and there’s another bit of news....

"": The Imperial Office said that at today’s gathering, there was a small disturbance among the young ladies.

** Apparently, our young lady made the other girl cry.

"": ...!

"": So the young lady does quarrel sometimes.

"": And even made her opponent cry.

"": They’re children, after all. It’s natural to grow through a few fights.

page 10

"": And it’s better to hit than to get hit.

"": That may be so.

"": If Arellin takes after Valer...

"": Should we discipline her firmly in advance to prevent trouble?

"": If she takes after His Grace the Duke, wouldn’t disciplining be useless?

"": ....

"": Isn’t it better to keep things peaceful?

"": Still, if she needs to be scolded, she must be scolded….

"" Mooooom!

() Oh no, of all times, right when we’re talking about scolding....

page 11

"": Arell.

"": Did you enjoy your dinner?

"": Yeah, it was good.

"": Mom, are you busy?

"": No, not at all.

() I worried for nothing…

page 12

"" Sob, hic...

"": Ah, stop crying!!

"": Because of you, we can’t even go back to the mansion!

"" But, Lesliii.

"" D-do I have to go to Halbern and apologize?

"": What apology! It was just a tea party. Not even a proper tea party.

"" S-still.

"": Who yells at someone just because they said a wrong word?

"": This is all because they weren’t taught manners!

"" But, hic, if I, later, get angry because they ignored me…

page 13

"": What are you going to do if she gets angry?

"": She doesn’t get any attention at home anyway!

"": Who would even listen to her?

"": And yet...

"": she just mocks me like I’m not even worth dealing with....

"": I won’t let it slide…!

<> I’ll trample her down no matter what!

** L-Lesli, are you okay?

"": Lady Lesli.

"": I just thought of a good idea…

"": How about listening to it?
