“”: Huh?

**: Hyunsu · Now
**: Hello, President. I'm contacting you to keep the promise we made the other day.
**: [Push to reply] >>

“”: It's Hyunsu, isn't it?

"": But...

"": A promise?

"": Ah!

page 2
"": Perhaps the artifact mentioned that day?

[]: Are there any changes to the requested artifact effects? I plan to craft and send it to you soon.

(): Hyunsu, if you can make the artifact I need right now...

[]: No changes. Hyunsu, what was your level again?

[]: It's 59 ^^;

(): Still quite low.

[]: If it's not too much trouble, I'll entrust it to you, Hyunsu.

"": Still, well...

//: Since he's a promising young man, it should be okay to have a little expectation.

page 3
"": Should I try placing a request with the 'Blacksmith Hyun' as well?

"": ...Never mind. I heard he doesn't even accept requests from rankers, so there's no way he'd take a request from an unofficial tanker like me.

(): But I don't have much time left before the class advancement quest opportunity expires,

"": Still, it's worth a try...!

<> Frost Mine

"": Wow!

"": So this is the Frost Mine......!

<> You are the first user to enter the Frost Mine.

<> EXP gain will be doubled for one week.

(): Being the first to enter... somehow feels good, doesn't it?

(): And I even get double EXP!

"": Ms. Bella, have you been here before?

"": No, this is my first time too.

page 5
(): It's still freezing cold here;

"": How did you get here?

"": This isn't a place one can enter without permission.

"": I am Bella, Vice Captain of the Royal Knights.

"": I entered with permission from the royal family.

"": Wow, the royal family?

"": Is this a royal seal? It's my first time seeing one!!

"": Hello, I'm the miner Banya.

"": I'm the blacksmith, Hyunsu.

page 6
"": It's nice to see outsiders after so long,

//: But we can't just let anyone into this mine!

"": Then, what should we do...

"": But luckily!

//: My father is the mining foreman!!

"": Let me take you to him.

"": This way.

"": Thank you...?

"": No need for thanks!

page 7
"": Huh?

"": Isn't these monsters  over there?

"": Ah, that's fascinating, right?

"": It's said to be a kind of dungeon.

[]: I heard that in the past, monsters used to pop out all over the mine.

[]: But 100 years ago, a mage who came here sealed them inside that mine.

"": Don't tell me that thing attached to those monsters...

page 8
"": Is it the Hundred-Year Cold Iron?

"": That's right. But if you get greedy, you'll be in for big trouble.

"": Because inside the sealing barrier is their territory.

"": You can enter, but it'll be hard to come back alive.

"": We miners also find it a pity, since that mine likely has the most minerals left.

"": But still, since they're trapped inside and we can work safely, we should be satisfied with that!

"": We've arrived. That person over there is my father.

page 9
"": Father!! We have guests, guests!!

"": I've guided them here, so I'll be on my way now!

"": Thank you for letting me know.

(): I wonder why an outsider has come all the way here?

"": Excuse me, pardon the interruption.

page 10
"": A royal knight... and

"": An outsider, is it?

"": That's correct.

"": Hmm...

[]: Mining Foreman Rex Lv.231

"": That's an unusual combination.

//: What brings you here?

"": I am looking for Hundred-Year Cold Iron, or rather, a mineral even superior to it.

"": A mineral superior to Hundred-Year Cold Iron?

"": Yes, might you know of one?

(): A mineral better than Hundred-Year Cold Iron?

(): It exists, but I have no reason to tell you.

page 11
OT: Especially not to a greedy outsider!

(): If word gets out that such a thing exists in the Frost Mine,

(): this mine will surely fall into chaos.

(): But this outsider came with royal permission.

(): I need a good way to persuade them to leave peacefully...

"": You, have you ever mined for minerals before?

page 12
"": No.

"": An average miner digs up about 3 minerals per day.

"": If you can mine 40 minerals within a week,

//: I'll share my information with you.

<> [Quest]
 

"": So, will you accept my proposal?

"": What if...

page 13
"": What if I mine more than 40?

"": That's unlikely to happen, but if you succeed, I'll personally mine the mineral for you.

ST: Just so you know, you can't receive help from your companions.

"": Do you promise?

"": Alright, it's a promise.

"": Then I'll see you in a week.

"": By the way...

"": Banya! I know you're hiding over there! Come out!!

page 14
"": Where do you think you're running off to when you're injured??

//: All you do is eavesdrop secretly!

"": Ouch, ouch! Father, I'm sorry!

"": Sir Hyunsu. Why did you provoke Miner Rex like that?

"": Actually, because I knew I was coming to the mine,

"": I had prepared something in advance.

"": A better mineral... I will obtain it no matter what...!

(): No matter how I think about it, it seems His Majesty has taken in a rather strange person as a close friend...?

page 15
[]: One week later

(): They say that outsider hasn't left the mine for a whole week.

(): But no matter what, it's an impossible task.

"": Huh?!

ST: Haha~

"": You finally came out, outsider!

"": At least your face looks like a miner's now!

//: Since the promised deadline has arrived,

"": Show me the results.

page 16
"": Just a moment-

(): I knew it.

(): There's no way an outsider could pull off somethi...

"": It's 200 in total.

<> Y-you, what exactly are you?!

<> Don't tell me you're a legendary miner???
