"": Eh?! That’s strange...

"": Isn’t that a phoenix? It’s bright red, just like the one I saw in a picture book!

"": Ah... ahaha...

(): Even Victory’s calling it a phoenix!

// Well, children do have vivid imaginations.

"": Anyway, it’s a new friend, so you two better get along!

st: Wah

"": So cute♡

st: I want to pet it too!

st: More importantly...

"": Your Highness, you’re really amazing!

// Didn’t even a cat cozy up to you the other day?

"": A true talent, even animals adore you!!

"": Ah... well...

(): Looks like Rosa introduced her cats to these children as well.

st: She must care for them quite a lot

"": But Joy and Pippi... the names are totally different.

"": !

"": Joy and Pippi! They’re both adorable!

page 2

"": That’s true, but...

"": W-Wait. Did you just say Joy?

"": Didn’t you introduce him the other day too?

(): Joy... could it be that Joy I know...?

[]: The treacherous minister who adored Rosa as much as the Hestia siblings did.

[]: Joy Terraiev, priest of Terra, god of the earth!

[]: In my past life, after receiving a divine oracle, Rosa met him...

// He was always by her side, like a shadow.

[]: Back then, and even now, I never knew what kind of person he truly was...

[]: Thinking back, Rosa seemed to change after she started spending time with him.

(): Of course, it’s only a coincidence that the name is the same, but...

(): That cat... it wasn’t any ordinary cat.

page 3

(): All the more reason to stay cautious!

"": Now that I think about it... nothing bad happened when you met Joy, right?

"": Eh?

"": Actually... Joy was a stray cat.

// I just wondered if he frightened you.

"": I was scared!

"": I wanted to pet Joy, but Joy wouldn’t let me!

OT: Not fair, not fair!

"": Victory, your voice is too loud...

"": True... but she's right, Joy only warms up to the Princess.

"": Cats are fickle creatures...

"": That’s true, but...

"": This may sound a little odd...

page 4

"": …But sometimes I feel like Joy is more of a human than a cat.

"": Just like a shy child!

"": Ah, no, I didn’t mean it as an offense,,,

"": It’s fine, I asked, so feel free to tell me.

// Why do you think that?

st: Wah...

"": Um... first of all, he can tell people apart.

"": And it’s like he has thoughts of his own...

"": Whenever a bird flew, he would always look up at the sky.

"": But he didn’t look hungry... more like he was searching for something.

(): Searching...?

page 5

(): Don’t tell me he was planning it all along... was he targeting Pippi?

(): Waiting for an opening, attacking again and again...?

(): If Gray’s story is true, no matter what he really is, this is weird...!

"": I see... thank you for telling me, Gray.

(): That cat roaming the palace is dangerous.

"": Listen... I have a request for you.

"": Anything, Princess!

"": The truth is... lately, Joy has been messing up the garden.

"": So I’ve decided to keep some distance.

// If you see me not playing with him, don’t be surprised.

st: Hmph

"": Breaking the garden is bad! Joy’s a bad kitty!

"": Victory! How could you say that about Her Highness’s friend...

"": It’s fine. Wrong is wrong.

(): That much explanation should be enough for these children.

page 6

OT: As for that cat, I need to keep investigating and stay on guard...!

 

[]: A few days later, in the royal garden.

(): After that, no new information about the cat came in.

(): But that doesn’t mean I have time to waste.

OT: My goal in this life is to win my family over to my side!

(): But still...

"": Icarus, what are you doing here?

page 7

"": His Majesty has ordered me to protect you, Princess.

[]: With him hovering over me, I can’t relax or concentrate...!

(): Sigh... anyway, I’ll just try not to worry about it.

(): I already decided I’d guide Icarus onto a better path this time!

"": Oh, Icarus, could you help me with something?

"": What would you have me do?

"": I want to make a bouquet for Daddy.

"": Shall I call the gardener?

st: Tch

(): That’s not what I meant, idiot!

st: I meant let’s make it together!

"": ...?

"": Understood. Let us go at once.

"": Huh... wait! I can walk on my own!!
page 8
(): Honestly... it’s going to take some time to get along with Icarus.

(): Hmm...

(): There really are so many beautiful flowers here.

st: You know the garden’s layout well, Icarus

"": !

"": Good day, Princess Rostel. How may I be of service?

"": Good morning! So you’re the gardener here!

"": I’m glad to meet... huh?

page 9

"": What happened to your arm? Did you get hurt?

"": Ah… it’s nothing. Just a little accident at work...

 

"": No way... don’t tell me that...

"": My cat did it?

"": Eh?! N-No, Princess!

// It really was just work!

(): Hm? Why’s he lying...? There’s no need for that.

st: Ah!

(): He's hiding it because Rosa treasures that cat!

page 10

"": It’s fine, tell me the truth.

// Just because it’s a friend doesn’t mean I’ll defend every wrong.

"": Princess...

"": The truth is... that cat is very hostile toward people.

// Several maids besides me have been hurt.

(): I knew it! Just as I suspected...

"": He's not an issue unless you run into it, but...

// There’s a small hole in the garden where it often appears.

"": A hole...?

(): So that’s how... it always seemed strange where it came from...

(): Turns out there was an entrance.

(): Alright... I’ve decided!

"": In that case...

"": If we block that hole, no one will get hurt, right?

(): From now on, he's not getting through!
